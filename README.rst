Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages 
rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. We’re glad you’re here!

Documentation
All documentation is available in the docs directory and 
online at https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/. To get started, we recommend the following:

  Installation: See docs/intro/install.txt for installation instructions.

  Deployment: When you're ready to set up a production server, check out docs/howto/deployment/index.txt.

  Topical Guides: Browse through docs/topics for deeper insights into specific aspects of Django.

  Reference: The docs/ref section provides detailed technical information and specifications.

  For building an HTML version of the docs, refer to docs/README.

RUNNIGNPYTHON SCRIPTS ON WINDOWS
  
  To ensure a consistent experience across different environments, 
  Windows users should use the py launcher when running Python scripts. This aligns with our updated documentation:

bash code:
        py manage.py runserver
        py runtests.py
  Using py ensures compatibility and is especially useful for beginners who may encounter 
  differences between py and python commands on various systems.
